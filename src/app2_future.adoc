== Appendix: future work

=== Register relocation

It has been suggested that `*wid*` registers could possibly be encoded in
`mseccfg` and `*envcfg` registers, or some other kind of consolidation to
reduce the number of registers involved in a context-switch.

TBD: once the register definition settles down, solicit ideas for this and
judge their cost-benefit.

=== Requirements

This document is so far mostly concerned with the solution, it should say more
about the problems it solves.
