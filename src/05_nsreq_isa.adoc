[[nsreqISA]]
== "NS-Req" ISA extension set

=== Preamble

* The World-ID extension set is augmented;
** The Swidns extension - addition of `mwidseclist` and its behavior. (See
   <<smwidns>>.)
** The Swidnsc extension - enforcement of sane relationships between the NS-Req
   security levels of the (WIDs associated with the) 3 hart privilege levels.
   (See <<smwidnsc>>).

=== NS-Req definition

There are two distinct NS-Req values, also referred to as NS-Req "security
levels";

* "Secure", which is represented by the value `0`, and
* "Non-Secure", which is represented by the value `1`.

The Swidsl extension adds the `mwidseclist` CSR that is like the WID bitmask
registers in <<isa>> in that it holds a single bit per WID, for up to `XLEN`
WIDs. Each bit in `mwidseclist` holds the NS-Req security level for the
corresponding WID.

[[smwidns]]
=== Smwidns - NS-Req assignments and signalling

This extension is dependent on Smwid.

==== `mwidseclist`

The `mwidseclist` register is defined in <<nsRegisterMap>>, and provides a
means for associating each WID with a corresponding NS-Req.

Whether all harts (and other initiators) in a given system should have the same
WID/NS-Req associations is beyond the scope of this document, though it would
be natural for WID/NS-Req associations to be consistent.

==== Locking

It is important to note that the `mwidseclist` CSR is lockable, it is locked
conjointly with `mwid` and `mwidlist` whenever `mwid` has its `L` bit set. See
<<lockablePartitioning>> for more detail.

==== Signaling

The World-ID extensions have already created a new "WID" field that can be
signalled on outgoing transactions, this may possibly be encoded in AxNSAID on
AXI5. By enabling the Smwidns extension, another new field, "NS-Req", is
created that can be signalled on outgoing transactions.

Whether these fields are used and how they are encoded depends on bus protocols
and integration choices.

To interact with TrustZone(R) targets, the Boolean NS-Req concept is signalled
in the AxPROT[1] bit on AXI protocols.

[[smwidnsc]]
=== Smwidnsc - NS-Req privilege constraints

This extension is dependent on Smwidns. For it to have any use, it makes sense
for at least Smwidl to be enabled.

A run-time privilege constraint is defined that mimics the behavior expected of
TEE-like software models, namely a lower privilege level cannot be more secure
the privilege levels above it. In RISC-V terms, and bearing in mind that 'more
secure' corresponds to a lower NS-Req _value_;

....
    SecurityLevel(M-mode) <= SecurityLevel(HS-mode)
    SecurityLevel(HS-mode) <= SecurityLevel(LS-mode)
    SecurityLevel(HS-mode) <= SecurityLevel(HU-mode)
    SecurityLevel(VS-mode) <= SecurityLevel(VU-mode)
....

The following list shows the process for determining whether to accept or
reject a load/store/fetch transaction with the Swidnsc extension enabled. See
<<decisionLogic>> for more information on how rejections are handled.

* The NS-Req security level of a privilege mode is determined by using that
  privilege level's WID as an index into the `mwidseclist` CSR. Zero is an
  appropriate default for parts that require no NS-Req support.
* If the hart is in (H)S-mode and the security level of (H)S-mode is superior
  to the security level of M-mode, reject transaction.
* If the hart is in VS-mode and the security level of VS-mode is superior to
  the security level of HS-mode, reject transaction.
* If the hart is in (H)U-mode and the security level of U-mode is superior to
  the security level of (H)S-mode, reject transaction.
* If the hart is in VU-mode and the security level of VS-mode is superior to
  the security level of HS-mode, reject transaction.
* The "effective NS-Req" is the NS-Req of the current privilege level.

It should be noted that, semantically, a privilege constraint fails on the
first instruction fetch after the `xRET` instruction, even if the
implementation detects the anomalous condition earlier than that. Similarly,
after the fault, the values in `xstatus/xcause/`[...] will reflect the
instruction address and privilege mode targetted by the `xRET` instruction.

[[nsRegisterMap]]
=== Register map addition

==== Summary

[%header,cols="2,2,2,2,3"]
|===
| Register | Access | Proposed offset | Suggested default | Description
| `mwidseclist` | RW for M until locked | ??? | `0x0` | NS-Req security level of WIDs
|===

==== `mwidseclist`: Security Level of WIDs

[%header,cols="1,2,5"]
|===
| Name | Bits | Description
| MASK | `[XLEN-1]:0`
| Bit-vector holding the NS-Req security level for each WID.
|===

This register is locked if and only if the `mwid` register is. The
`mwidseclist` CSR ignores writes when locked by `mwid`. CSR writes to
`mwidseclist` and `mwid` are ordered by the hardware in the same manner as
writes to ePMP registers.  When necessary, software can enforce a specific
ordering between a CSR write and other instructions with an appropriate FENCE.

Only the registers (and bits thereof) that are required are implemented. For
WIDs greater than or equal to `NWorlds`, the (remaining) bits are read-only
zero.
