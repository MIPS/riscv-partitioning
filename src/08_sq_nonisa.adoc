== "eIOPMP Security Qualifiers" non-ISA extension

This section details enhancements on top of the eIOPMP Security Levels
extension set. However there is very little that needs saying for this
extension!

<<sqISA>> defines the Security Qualifier (in <<sq>>) and describes how the
implementation is required to maintain the Security Qualifier state for all
hart-accessible address ranges. Well, this non-ISA extension requires the
implementation to maintain that same state for all eIOPMP-accessible address
ranges also.

With this extension (enabled), the eIOPMP commits to enforcing the same
relationships (between the Security Level of an input transaction and the
Security Qualifier(s) for the target address range) as described in the ISA
extension.
