== "eIOPMP NS-Attr registry" non-ISA extension

=== Preamble

This extension extends the "eIOPMP NS-Attr" non-ISA extension. It implements
the same mechanism as seen in the "ePMP NS-Attr registry" ISA extension, which
is to say that the each eIOPMP entry is associated with the NS-Attr security
attribute for that address-range.

Register details TBD.
