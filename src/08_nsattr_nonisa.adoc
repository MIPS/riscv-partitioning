[[nsattrNonISA]]
== "eIOPMP NS-Attr" non-ISA extension

This section details enhancements on top of the eIOPMP NS-Req extension.
However there is very little that needs saying for this extension!

<<nsattrISA>> defines the NS-Attr security attribute type (in <<nsattr>>) and
describes how the implementation is required to maintain the NS-Attr state for
all hart-accessible address ranges. Well, this non-ISA extension requires the
implementation to maintain that same state for all eIOPMP-accessible address
ranges also.

With this extension (enabled), the eIOPMP commits to enforcing the same
relationships (between the NS-Req of an input transaction and the NS-Attr
security attribute(s) for the target address range) as described in the ISA
extension.
