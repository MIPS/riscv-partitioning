[[sqeiopmpNonISA]]
== "eIOPMP Security Qualifiers" non-ISA extension

=== Preamble

This extension extends the eIOPMP Security Qualifiers non-ISA extension. It
implements the same mechanism as seen in the ePMP Security Qualifiers ISA
extension, which is to say that the eIOPMP entries become the custodians of the
Security Qualifier for the associated address-range.

Register details TBD.
