[WARNING]

====
Assume everything can change. This draft specification will change before
being accepted as standard, so implementations made to this draft
specification will likely not conform to the future standard.

= "Worlds" baseline

This section of the proposal concerns the baseline definitions for "Worlds",
system-level resource domains. Each World is identified by a World ID, or
"WID", which is tagged onto all load, store, and fetch transactions issued by
initiators belonging to that world.

In the case of hart-issued transactions, each privilege level is associated
with a World ID, which is used to tag all transactions issued by the
instructions executing at that privilege level.

This section of the document covers;

* <<isa>>, the "World-ID" ISA extension set. This is derived from the original
  WorldGuard v0.4 proposal from SiFive by making some tweaks and adding support
  for the Hypervisor extension. It provides support for World-based marking of
  core-initiated transactions.
* <<eiopmp>>, the "eIOPMP extension". This is derived from v0.7 of the draft
  IOPMP specification by making some tweaks and clarifications, as well as
  adding support for match-based output WID/RRID. I.e. an eIOPMP that can map
  from an input WID namespace to an output WID namespace.

= NS-Req

This section of the proposal concerns the "NS-Req" concept from TrustZone(R),
also known as "the NS bit". It allows the otherwise symmetric concept of a
World to be qualified according to its degree of security criticality, "Secure"
or "Non-Secure", creating an asymmetric relationship between Worlds of the two
different security levels.

This section of the document covers;

* <<nsreqISA>>, the "NS-Req" ISA extension set. This defines the `mwidseclist` CSR
  and associated behavior, and also enforces sane relationships between the
  NS-Req security levels of the hart's 3 privilege levels.
* <<nsreqNonISA>>, the "eIOPMP NS-Req" non-ISA extension. This is to the eIOPMP
  what the "NS-Req" ISA extension is to the hart, allowing each World ID to be
  associated with a corresponding NS-Req security level.

= NS-Attr

This section of the proposal concerns the "NS-Attr" concept from TrustZone(R), a
security attribute that can be associated with target addresses and that can be
compared against a transaction to provide security level-based access control.

This section of the document covers;

* <<nsattrISA>>, the "NS-Attr" ISA extension. This defines the memory attribute
  type that can be used to provide access-control to contexts that are
  represented by a NS-Req security level. The extension provides the functionality
  that causes a hart (probably through "ePMP") to implement access control
  based on NS-Req and NS-Attr.
* <<nsattrNonISA>>, the "eIOPMP NS-Attr" non-ISA extension. This is to the
  eIOPMP what the "NS-Attr" ISA extension is to the hart, implementing access
  control based on NS-Req security level and NS-Attr security attributes.

= PMP registration of NS-Attr attributes

This section of the proposal concerns an optional way for implementations to
perform the task of associating NS-Attr security attributes with all accessible
address ranges.

As defined up to this point, NS-Attr security attributes, like PMAs (Physical
Memory Attributes), are managed in an implementation-defined manner. Indeed,
they may be implemented as a PMA type. For other platforms, this extension
provides an alternative way to record NS-Attr security attributes, by extending
ePMP (for harts) and eIOPMP (for devices).

This section of the document covers;

* <<nsattrregISA>>, the "ePMP NS-Attr registry" ISA extension. This defines the
  `pmpnsX` registers that allow ePMP to record, on a per-PMP-entry basis, the
  NS-Attr security attributes for the corresponding address ranges.
* <<nsattrregNonISA>>, the "eIOPMP NS-Attr registry" non-ISA extension. This is
  to the eIOPMP what the "ePMP NS-Attr register" extension is to the ePMP,
  whereby per-IOPMP-entry recording of NS-Attr security attributes is
  supported.
